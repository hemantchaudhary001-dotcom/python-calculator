🧮 Simple Python Calculator
A beginner-friendly calculator built with Python that performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This project is part of my Python learning journey and showcases foundational programming skills.
🚀 Features
- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)
- Input validation and error handling

  
📦 How to Run
- Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.x).
- Clone this repository or download the .py file.
- Open your terminal or command prompt.
- Run the script:
python calculator.py


🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Basic control flow (if, elif, else)
- Functions
- Input/output handling

  
📚 What I Learned
- Writing clean and readable Python code
- Handling user input and errors
- Structuring a simple CLI program
- Using Git and GitHub for version control

  
🧠 Future Improvements
